# Caspr
A convenient UI component library for [Jaspr](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main). Inspired by Flutter's widgets.

Caspr attempts to design its components to encapsulate HTML elements and give Jaspr more of a flutter-like feel. Much like Flutter widget libraries handle most of the low-level intricacies of app development out of the box.

## Target 
If you are a Flutter developer, with minimal HTML/CSS experience and need a SSR or SSG website, or just a client-side app with good SEO, and Flutter Web is not working for you, Caspr is for you! We want to make using Jaspr and HTML website/app creation more approachable for beginners especially those coming from Flutter. 

## Caspr does this by

- Using easy-to-read and common-sense attributes
- Encapsulating all of Jaspr's basic DOM components
  - e.x The NavBar component for a website navbar has all the HTML/CSS manipulation done out-of-box
- Easier Styling with customizable presets
  - No more dealing with CSS styling attributes
  - All the CSS intricacies will have been dealt with for common-use components

If anything is missing or needs to be extended, developers can always use Jaspr's lower-level components. But we will work to make sure you don't have to.


## Caspr has 2 subsections:
 - Material - like Flutter's Material widgets based on Material UI
   - Based on [Material Components for web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
 - Utility Components - simple Utility Components that extend Jaspr's ease of use
